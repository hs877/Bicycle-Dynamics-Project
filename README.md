# Description

This project is surrounded by my fascination of bicycle dynamics. I am deeply interested in the dynamics presented by J. P. Meijaard1, Jim M. Papadopoulos, Andy Ruina and A. L. Schwab in "Linearized dynamics equations for the balance and steer of a bicycle: a benchmark and review". This project takes the propulive, rolling, ans steering torque dynamics presented by this paper.
